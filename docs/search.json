We explore the role of broad sectoral shifts in labor demand over this period in explaining this trend. We first quantify changes in local employment and population in response to local labor demand shifts for both groups of workers. We then combine our estimates with a stylized model that incorporates frictional local labor markets and imperfect mobility across markets. Our framework enables us to aggregate local responses while accounting for geographic mobility and regional employment composition. We find that sectoral reallocation can explain around one-fifth of the total exacerbation in the employment-to-population ratio differential between Black and White men over 1970–2010. Out-migration from harder-hit markets, while large, does not mitigate the impact of negative labor demand shifts. We also find that most of the predicted change in the employment differential is due to differential response rather than differential exposure to shifts across two groups.\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\n\n    \n      \n\n        \n        Duration Dependence and Heterogeneity: Learning from Early Notice of Layoff\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n            Current Draft\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n            arXiv\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n            Data & Code\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n         Abstract\n        \n            This paper presents a novel approach to distinguish the impact of duration dependent forces and adverse selection on the exit rate from unemployment by leveraging variation in the length of layoff notices. I formulate a Mixed Hazard model in discrete time and specify the conditions under which variation in notice length enables the identification of structural duration dependence while allowing for arbitrary heterogeneity across workers. Utilizing data from the Displaced Worker Supplement (DWS), I employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to estimate the model. According to the estimates, the decline in the exit rate over the first 48 weeks of unemployment is largely due to the worsening composition of surviving jobseekers. Furthermore, I find that an individual's likelihood of exiting unemployment decreases initially, then increases until unemployment benefits run out, and remains steady thereafter. These findings are consistent with a standard search model where returns to search decline early in the spell.\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n      \n    \n      \n\n        \n        Discrete Time Mixed Proportional Hazard Model\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n         Abstract\n        \n            This paper provides a constructive proof of identification for the discrete-time variant of the Mixed Proportional Hazard model.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that the estimator also performs well in finite samples.\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Papers\n\n\n    \n      \n\n        \n        Who do you ask?
